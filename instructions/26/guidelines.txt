Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Reflow:
Content can be presented without loss of information or functionality, and without requiring scrolling in two dimensions for:

Vertical scrolling content at a width equivalent to 320 CSS pixels;

Horizontal scrolling content at a height equivalent to 256 CSS pixels;

Except for parts of the content which require two-dimensional layout for usage or meaning.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - C32: Using media queries and grid CSS to reflow columns
   - C31: Using CSS Flexbox to reflow content
   - C33: Allowing for Reflow with Long URLs and Strings of Text
   - C38: Using CSS width, max-width and flexbox to fit labels and inputs
   - SCR34: Calculating size and position in a way that scales with text size
   - G206: Providing options within the content to switch to a layout that does not require the user to scroll horizontally to read a line of text
Failures include:
   - F102: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.10 due to content disappearing and not being available when content has reflowed
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
