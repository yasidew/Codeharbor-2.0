Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Use of Color:
Color is not used as the only visual means of conveying information, indicating an action, prompting a response, or distinguishing a visual element.

Note 1: This success criterion addresses color perception specifically. Other forms of perception are covered in Guideline 1.3 including programmatic access to color and other visual presentation coding.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G14: Ensuring that information conveyed by color differences is also available in text
   - G205: Including a text cue for colored form control labels
   - G182: Ensuring that additional visual cues are available when text color differences are used to convey information
   - G183: Using a contrast ratio of 3:1 with surrounding text and providing additional visual cues on hover for links or controls where color alone is used to identify them
   - G111: Using color and pattern
Failures include:
   - F13: Failure of Success Criterion 1.1.1 and 1.4.1 due to having a text alternative that does not include information that is conveyed by color differences in the image
   - F73: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to creating links that are not visually evident without color vision
   - F81: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.1 due to identifying required or error fields using color differences only
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
