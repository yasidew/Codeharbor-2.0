Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Content on Hover or Focus:
Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:

Dismissible: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an input error or does not obscure or replace other content;

Hoverable: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;

Persistent: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.

Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - SCR39: Making content on focus or hover hoverable, dismissible, and persistent
Failures include:
   - F95: Failure of Success Criterion 1.4.13 due to content shown on hover not being hoverable
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
