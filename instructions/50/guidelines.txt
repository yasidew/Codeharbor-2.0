Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AAA guidelines for Link Purpose (Link Only):
A mechanism is available to allow the purpose of each link to be identified from link text alone, except where the purpose of the link would be ambiguous to users in general.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - ARIA8: Using aria-label for link purpose
   - G91: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link
   - H30: Providing link text that describes the purpose of a link for anchor elements
   - H24: Providing text alternatives for the area elements of image maps
   - G189: Providing a control near the beginning of the Web page that changes the link text
   - SCR30: Using scripts to change the link text
   - C7: Using CSS to hide a portion of the link text
   - PDF11: Providing links and link text using the Link annotation and the /Link structure element in PDF documents
   - PDF13: Providing replacement text using the /Alt entry for links in PDF documents
Failures include:
   - F84: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.9 due to using a non-specific link such as 'click here' or 'more' without a mechanism to change the link text to specific text
   - F89: Failure of Success Criteria 2.4.4, 2.4.9 and 4.1.2 due to not providing an accessible name for an image which is the only content in a link
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
