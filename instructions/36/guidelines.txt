Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AAA guidelines for Interruptions:
Interruptions can be postponed or suppressed by the user, except interruptions involving an emergency.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G75: Providing a mechanism to postpone any updating of content
   - G76: Providing a mechanism to request an update of the content instead of updating automatically
   - SCR14: Using scripts to make nonessential alerts optional
Failures include:
   - F40: Failure due to using meta redirect with a time limit
   - F41: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
