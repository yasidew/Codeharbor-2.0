Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Meaningful Sequence:
When the sequence in which content is presented affects its meaning, a correct reading sequence can be programmatically determined.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G57: Ordering the content in a meaningful sequence
   - H34: Using a Unicode right-to-left mark (RLM) or left-to-right mark (LRM) to mix text direction inline
   - H56: Using the dir attribute on an inline element to resolve problems with nested directional runs
   - C6: Positioning content based on structural markup
   - C8: Using CSS letter-spacing to control spacing within a word
   - C27: Making the DOM order match the visual order
   - PDF3: Ensuring correct tab and reading order in PDF documents
Failures include:
   - F34: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to format tables in plain text content
   - F33: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.1 and 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to create multiple columns in plain text content
   - F32: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using white space characters to control spacing within a word
   - F49: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to using an HTML layout table that does not make sense when linearized
   - F1: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.2 due to changing the meaning of content by positioning information with CSS
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
