Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Label in Name:
For user interface components with labels that include text or images of text, the name contains the text that is presented visually.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G208: Including the text of the visible label as part of the accessible name
   - G211: Matching the accessible name to the visible label
Failures include:
   - F96: Failure due to the accessible name not containing the visible label text
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
