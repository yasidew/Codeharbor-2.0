Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AAA guidelines for Focus Appearance:
When the keyboard focus indicator is visible, an area of the focus indicator meets all the following: is at least as large as the area of a 2 CSS pixel thick perimeter of the unfocused component or sub-component, and has a contrast ratio of at least 3:1 between the same pixels in the focused and unfocused states.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G195: Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator
   - C40: Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components
   - C41: Creating a strong focus indicator within the component
Failures include:
   - Using a CSS border for inline text which can wrap
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
