Sufficient techniques include:
   - H58: Using language attributes to identify changes in the human language
   - PDF19: Specifying the language for a passage or phrase with the Lang entry in PDF documents

After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
