Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Orientation:
Content does not restrict its view and operation to a single display orientation, such as portrait or landscape, unless a specific display orientation is essential.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G214: Using a control to allow access to content in different orientations which is otherwise restricted
Failures include:
   - F97: Failure due to locking the orientation to landscape or portrait view
   - F100: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.4 due to showing a message asking to reorient device
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
