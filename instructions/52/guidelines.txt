Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Focus Not Obscured (Minimum):
When a user interface component receives keyboard focus, the component is not entirely hidden due to author-created content.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - C43: Using CSS scroll-padding to un-obscure content
Failures include:
   - F110: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.11 Focus Not Obscured (Minimum) due to a sticky footer or header completely hiding focused elements
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
