Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Timing Adjustable:
For each time limit that is set by the content, at least one of the following is true: (See full criterion for details)
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G133: Providing a checkbox on the first page of a multipart form that allows users to ask for longer session time limit or no session time limit
   - G198: Providing a way for the user to turn the time limit off
   - G180: Providing the user with a means to set the time limit to 10 times the default time limit
   - SCR16: Providing a script that warns the user a time limit is about to expire AND SCR1: Allowing the user to extend the default time limit
   - G4: Allowing the content to be paused and restarted from where it was paused
   - SCR33: Using script to scroll content, and providing a mechanism to pause it
   - SCR36: Providing a mechanism to allow users to display moving, scrolling, or auto-updating text in a static window or area
Failures include:
   - F40: Failure due to using meta redirect with a time limit
   - F41: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
   - F58: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1 due to using server-side techniques to automatically redirect pages after a time-out
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
