Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AAA guidelines for Concurrent Input Mechanisms:
Web content does not restrict use of input modalities available on a platform except where the restriction is essential, required to ensure the security of the content, or required to respect user settings.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - Only using high-level, input-agnostic event handlers, such as focus, blur, click, in Javascript
Failures include:
   - F98: Failure due to interactions being limited to touch-only on touchscreen devices
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
