Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AAA guidelines for Change on Request:
Changes of context are initiated only by user request or a mechanism is available to turn off such changes.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G76: Providing a mechanism to request an update of the content instead of updating automatically
   - SVR1: Implementing automatic redirects on the server side instead of on the client side
   - G110: Using an instant client-side redirect
   - H76: Using meta refresh to create an instant client-side redirect
   - H83: Using the target attribute to open a new window on user request and indicating this in link text
   - SCR24: Using progressive enhancement to open new windows on user request
   - SCR19: Using an onchange event on a select element without causing a change of context
Failures include:
   - F60: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to launching a new window when a user enters text into an input field
   - F61: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to complete change of main content through an automatic update that the user cannot disable from within the content
   - F9: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to changing the context when the user removes focus from a form element
   - F22: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.5 due to opening windows that are not requested by the user
   - F52: Failure of Success Criterion 3.2.1 and 3.2.5 due to opening a new window as soon as a new page is loaded
   - F40: Failure due to using meta redirect with a time limit
   - F41: Failure of Success Criterion 2.2.1, 2.2.4, and 3.2.5 due to using meta refresh to reload the page
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
