Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Captions (Prerecorded):
Captions are provided for all prerecorded audio content in synchronized media, except when the media is a media alternative for text and is clearly labeled as such.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G93: Providing open (always visible) captions
   - G87: Providing closed captions using any readily available media format that has a video player that supports closed captioning
   - SM11: Providing captions through synchronized text streams in SMIL 1.0
   - SM12: Providing captions through synchronized text streams in SMIL 2.0
   - H95: Using the track element to provide captions
Failures include:
   - F8: Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.2 due to captions omitting some dialogue or important sound effects
   - F75: Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.2 by providing synchronized media without captions when the synchronized media presents more information than is presented on the page
   - F74: Failure of Success Criterion 1.2.2 and 1.2.8 due to not labeling a synchronized media alternative to text as an alternative
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
