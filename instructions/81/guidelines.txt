Information previously entered by or provided to the user that is required to be entered again in the same process is either: auto-populated, or available for the user to select. Except when: re-entering the information is essential, the information is required to ensure the security of the content, or previously entered information is no longer valid.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G221: Provide data from a previous step in a process
   - Not requesting the same information twice
Failures include:
   - No specific failures listed.
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
