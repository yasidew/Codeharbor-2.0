Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Focus Visible:
Any keyboard operable user interface has a mode of operation where the keyboard focus indicator is visible.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G149: Using user interface components that are highlighted by the user agent when they receive focus
   - C15: Using CSS to change the presentation of a user interface component when it receives focus
   - G165: Using the default focus indicator for the platform so that high visibility default focus indicators will carry over
   - G195: Using an author-supplied, visible focus indicator
   - C40: Creating a two-color focus indicator to ensure sufficient contrast with all components
   - SCR31: Using script to change the background color or border of the element with focus
Failures include:
   - F55: Failure of Success Criteria 2.1.1, 2.4.7, and 3.2.1 due to using script to remove focus when focus is received
   - F78: Failure of Success Criterion 2.4.7 due to styling element outlines and borders in a way that removes or renders non-visible the visual focus indicator
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
