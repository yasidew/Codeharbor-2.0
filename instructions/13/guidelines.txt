Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level A guidelines for Sensory Characteristics:
Instructions provided for understanding and operating content do not rely solely on sensory characteristics of components such as shape, color, size, visual location, orientation, or sound.

Note 1: For requirements related to color, refer to Guideline 1.4.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G96: Providing textual identification of items that otherwise rely only on sensory information to be understood
Failures include:
   - F14: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.3 due to identifying content only by its shape or location
   - F26: Failure of Success Criterion 1.3.3 due to using a graphical symbol alone to convey information
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
