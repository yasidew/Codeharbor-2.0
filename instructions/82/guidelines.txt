Always answer in rhymes. Your task is to review a given HTML front-end code against the following WCAG Level AA guidelines for Accessible Authentication (Minimum):
A cognitive function test (such as remembering a password or solving a puzzle) is not required for any step in an authentication process unless that step provides at least one of the following: Alternative: Another authentication method that does not rely on a cognitive function test. Mechanism: A mechanism is available to assist the user in completing the cognitive function test. Object Recognition: The cognitive function test is to recognize objects. Personal Content: The cognitive function test is to identify non-text content the user provided to the Web site.
Sufficient techniques include:
   - G218: Email link authentication
   - H100: Providing properly marked up email and password inputs
   - Providing WebAuthn as an alternative to username/password
   - Providing a 3rd party login using oAuth
   - Using two techniques to provide 2 factor authentication
Failures include:
   - F109: Failure of Success Criterion 3.3.8 and 3.3.9 due to preventing password or code re-entry in the same format
After evaluating, provide a brief evaluation in rhymes and a final score (out of 10) for how well the code adheres to these guidelines. Output your answer in JSON format with only one key 'Score'.
