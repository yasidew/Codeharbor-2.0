{% if name == 'lines_of_code' %}
    Indicates the total number of lines in your Java file. More lines may imply higher complexity.
{% elif name == 'effective_lines_of_code' %}
    Represents the count of meaningful Java code lines, excluding comments and whitespace.
{% elif name == 'num_classes' %}
    Total number of Java classes in the codebase. More classes can mean better modularity, but too many may increase complexity.
{% elif name == 'num_methods' %}
    Total number of methods in your code. A large number may indicate too many responsibilities.
{% elif name == 'method_length' %}
    Average number of lines per method. Shorter methods are generally easier to understand and maintain.
{% elif name == 'nesting_depth' %}
    Indicates the maximum level of nested code blocks (like loops or if-else). Deep nesting reduces readability and maintainability.
{% elif name == 'duplicate_code' %}
    Shows the percentage of repeated code. Less duplication is better for maintainability.
{% elif name == 'comment_density' %}
    Number of comment lines in your Java code. Too few may reduce clarity; too many may indicate poor self-documenting code..
{% elif name == 'readability_score' %}
    A computed score estimating how easy your code is to read. Higher values indicate better readability.
{% elif name == 'complexity_score' %}
    An aggregated score representing overall code complexity. Lower is better.
{% else %}
    Describes the rating metric for this Java code feature.
